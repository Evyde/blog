# Foreword
  About three years ago around 2015, I found I need to record something important by writting blog. But I didn't prefer to buy VPS or Hosting, and it is too hard to do it in free hostings. So I found github(gitcafe) and Hexo.
  - What is Hexo?
  It is a fantastic program which can help people creat their static blog page easily.

  - How Hexo works?
  It relys on Node.js, and can generate static html pages in your local device.

  - Why is Hexo?
  Fast, beautiful themes, easy to use, etc.

  This is the home page from my blog, in which you can see how beautiful it is.

  Then, if you want to know more about Hexo, you can check details in its wiki page, see [Hexo Wiki Page][1].

# Prepare
  > - A Linux or Mac computer.(Though Windows is ok, but I don't suggest you use it, if you still go on working on it, you will have a bad enough experience.)
  > - A github account.
  > - Be familiar with Markdown.
  > - Maybe a good VPN.

  Now, let's see how to install and use Hexo.

# Installation
## Install Node.js
  Download Node.js from its official website [Node.js][3], and follow its guide to install it. Now you get npm installed. To test whether the npm successfully installed, you can input
  ```bash
  npm -v && echo $?
  ```
  Then you will see a number 0, if not, check your Node.js installation.

## Install Git
  In macOS, you just need to input command such as `gcc` or `git` in terminal, then macOS will ask you if you need to download developer command line tools, just choose `Yes`.
  In Linux, you can use package control system like `apt` or `yum`.
  To check if git works, input
  ```bash
  git -v && echo $?
  ```
  Like last step of installing Node.js, you should see a number 0 now, too. If not, check [github][4] for more information.

## Install Hexo
  Just input
  ```bash
  npm install -g hexo-cli
  ```
  to install hexo on your system. Input
  ```bash
  hexo -v && echo $?
  ```
  to check if it installed successfully. For more infomation, you can go to [Hexo Wiki Page][1].

  From now on, you finished hexo installation, let's see how to use it.

  Before use it, you should creat a workspace for you blog at first.
  ```bash
  mkdir blog
  cd blog
  ```
  Unless special mention, we will use this directory by default.

## Install Git Deployer
  You need to install a git deployer to push your blog into github, Input
  ```bash
  npm install hexo-deployer-git --save
  ```
  > Notice: You should reinstall it whenever you have a new blog.

  Then, modify your `_config.yml` to make it avaliable. Add these contents at the end of the file.
  ```yaml
  deploy:
    type: git
    repo: <repository url>
    branch: [branch]
    message: [message]
  ```
  > Notice: This file is in your blog directory.

  | Argument    | Description                         |
  | :-:         | :-:                                 |
  | type        | The type of deployer, here is git   |
  | repo        | Your git repository url, ssh or http|
  | branch      | Repository branch, like `master`    |
  | message     | Commit message, usually don't mind  |


# Simple Usage
  Initialize your blog by inputing
  ```bash
  hexo init
  ```
  After a while, you can get a default blog. But you need to modify `_config.yml` to customlize your blog.

  | Argument    | Description              |
  |    :-:      |            :-:           |
  | title       | Website title            |
  | subtitle    | Website subtitle         |
  | description | Use for SEO              |
  | author      | Blog author, your name   |
  | language    | Your website language    |
  | timezone    | Don't mind it            |
  | url         | Your blog url            |
  | theme       | Which theme you use      |

  > Notice: Every argument follow the syntax like this:
  ```yaml
  theme: landspace
  ```
  > There is A `SPACE` between the symbol `:` and `landspace`.


  Now, you can creat you first passage by
  ```bash
  hexo new [layout] <title>
  ```
  And you will see a new file in `./source/_post/`, modify it to draw your think.
  > Tips: If you want to add a jumpable content in your passage, you can do like this( don't need use html label).
  ```markdown
  [Guide1.1](#Title)
  ```
  > In this example, `Guide1.1` means the thing you want to show to readers. `Title` means the target where you want to jump, for example, in this passage, `Prepare` is a title, so I should write my content like this
  ```markdown
  [Prepare](#Prepare)
  ```
  > > Notice: If you meet a title which has more than one word, like `Install Node.js` in this passage, you should replace all the special symbols by `-`, for example
  ```markdown
  [Install Node.js](#Install-Node-js)
  ```
  or you can't reach your target.

  When creative things compelete rapidly, generate your passage by
  ```bash
  hexo g
  ```
  and submit by
  ```bash
  hexo d
  ```
  If you want to see its effact without submitting, input
  ```bash
  hexo s
  ```
  after generating. And you will see a message like
  ```bash
  (node:27254) [DEP0061] DeprecationWarning: fs.SyncWriteStream is deprecated.
  INFO  Start processing
  INFO  Hexo is running at http://localhost:4000/. Press Ctrl+C to stop.
  ```
  Then, go `http://localhost:4000/` to see your blog in local device.
  Also, there are two useful commands for you.
  ```bash
  hexo clean
  ```
  It means clean the generated files. You can use it whenever you have something wrong to deal with.
  ```bash
  hexo list
  ```
  List your website information.

# Backup
  First, you should creat an **another empty** repository in github. Then initialize git by inputing
  ```bash
  git init
  ```
  Then, add your blog files to the git repository by
  ```bash
  git add .
  ```
  > Notice: There is an `.` after `add`.

  Commit by inputing
  ```bash
  git commit -m "[Message]"
  ```
  You can replace `[Message]` by anything you like, it is the message submited to github to show the feature of this commit.
  Then, remote your repository by inputing
  ```bash
  git remote ssh://git@github.com:XXX/blog.git
  ```
  > Notice: `ssh` means the type which the deployer will use, if you add the public RSA key to the github, you can use this method, or change it to `https://`. `XXX` means your github username, and `blog` means your repository. If you use https method, you should write it in this way
  ```bash
  git remote https://github.com/XXX/blog.git
  ```

  Now finish your first backup by
  ```bash
  git push origin master
  ```
  `master` means the brach of your github repository, you should use it by default. Before changing it, you should creat a new brach in the github website.



# Restore
  If you have a new computer or you move your workspce, you need to restore your blog.
  First, you should install `git` and `Node.js`. And creat a new workspce by inputing
  ```bash
  mkdir workspace
  cd workspace
  ```
  > Notice: If your directory name is too long to type, just use `TAB` to help you.

  And clone your backuped blog by
  ```bash
  git clone ssh://git@github.com:XXX/blog.git
  ```
  Then, exec
  ```bash
  npm install hexo --save
  ```
  npm will install hexo in this directory automatically.
  By the way, install git deployer in this directory, see [Install Git Deployer](#Install-Git-Deployer).

  Now, you have your blog restored.

  > ****NOTICE: THIS BLOG IS NOT FINISHED, AND SOMETHING MUST BE WRONG BECAUSE I DID NOT TEST IT AT ALL****
